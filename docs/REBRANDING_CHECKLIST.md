## 🎨 Logo/Icon Next Steps

Since you want a color wheel for the main interface, consider:

### Favicon options:
1. **Simple "h&" text** in Fraunces font
2. **Minimalist color wheel** (small, recognizable at 16x16)
3. **Ampersand with color gradient**

### Full logo concepts:
1. **Text only** - "hex&hue" in Fraunces (current approach)
2. **Icon + text** - Small wheel icon next to name
3. **Integrated** - Color wheel forming the "&" symbol

**Recommendation:** Start with text-only, add icon later. The product is the brand right now.

## 📝 Notes

**The "&" is your brand signature.** Use it consistently:
- Always "hex&hue" not "hex and hue"
- The ampersand symbolizes the bridge between digital and physical
- It makes the name memorable and searchable

**Voice matters.** You're an introvert building for creators:
- Write conversationally (like teaching a friend)
- Focus on written content over video
- Let the product speak through clear demos
- Build community through thoughtful responses

**Paint mixing is your differentiator.** No other color tool does this:
- Lead with this in marketing
- Build comprehensive paint database
- Partner with paint brands?
- Create watercolor/acrylic/oil mixing guides
